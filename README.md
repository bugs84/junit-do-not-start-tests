# About project

Small project to demonstrate regression, after which junit5 stop excuting tests, which executed before.

##### Motivation
We have a quite big project with a lot of modules.  
We discovered this regression:  
We upgraded junit to version 5.6.2 and after few days we luckily found
, that tests in one module were not executed anymore! :(   What a pity :(
